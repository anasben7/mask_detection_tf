## Mask detection using TensorFlow with Keras, OpenCV and MobileNET

### For test purposes, we have built this on google Colab, before deploying it to our machines.

Building a Mask detection system for a company.
This system is connected to a screen in the company entry, so it's can detect if the people entering the building are wearing masks or not.
This system is found to be effective in the prevention of coronavirus spread.

This model is built using TensorFlow with Keras library, OpenCV and MobileNetV2.
